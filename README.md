# XenoNiche

**XenoNiche**  
*A comprehensive R toolkit for advanced spatial transcriptomics analysis of Xenium data*

XenoNiche is designed to streamline the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data generated by the Xenium platform. Built on top of Seurat, this package provides specialized functions for cell niche identification, neighborhood analysis, and spatial interaction inference tailored to Xeniumâ€™s high-resolution single-cell spatial data.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- Seamless integration with Seurat objects and workflows  
- Custom algorithms for quantifying spatial proximities between cell types and states  
- Tools to analyze directional signaling gradients and cellular microenvironment influences  
- Visualization modules optimized for Xenium data spatial layouts  
- Flexible functions addressing research questions in tissue microenvironment and cell-cell communication

## Purpose

XenoNiche empowers researchers to uncover detailed cellular architecture and intercellular signaling dynamics in complex tissues, accelerating discoveries in regenerative medicine, cancer biology, and systems biology.

## Installation

You can install XenoNiche directly from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

```r
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install XenoNiche from GitHub
devtools::install_github("ASA-SysBio/XenoNiche")
```
